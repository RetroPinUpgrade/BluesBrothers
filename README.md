Initial Ruleset  

## Mini Modes  
There are 3 mini modes the player can qualify & stack in order to put the band together.   
  
**Elwood:** Two drop target clears (adjustable) will qualify Elwood. Like Stars, clearing either bank counts as the first clear and then both drop banks need to be cleared the second & successive times. Once the banks have been cleared twice, the machine announces that Elwood is qualified and the scoop (VUK) is lit to start the mode. Mode start is on a timer--after 30 seconds it's not qualified anymore and the player has to clear 2 banks again to re-qualify.  
  
**Jake:** Lighting all the JAKE standups once (configurable) will qualify the JAKE mode. The mode can be started on the scoop (VUK) within 30 seconds.

**Band:** Collecting 500 spins qualifies the band. Alternating spinners will increase the spin count by 10, so hitting the left then the right with the orbit shot will get to the spin count faster. After 500 spins the mode can be started on the scoop (VUK) within 30 seconds.  
  
Two or three modes can be qualified at once, and qualifying a second or third mode will add 15 seconds to the mode start hurry-up. Each mode comes with a +1 playfield multiplier and modes are played as a 2-ball multiball. Add-a-ball is available on the loop shot (above right sling) while in the mode once a mode shot has been hit.  

### Mode shots: 
In Elwood mode, the player has to hit the lit drop target to score an Elwood shot.
In Jake mode, the player has to hit a lit standup to score a Jake shot.
In Band mode, either spinner scores a Band shot.

## Concert Multiball
If the player scores mode shots in each of the 3 mini modes, Concert Multiball will be qualified at the scoop (VUK). Two additional balls will be launched (and/or released) and the player can collect jackpots at the scoop (VUK). Jackpot is re-qualified by hitting a drop target, standup, and spinner. Jackpot value is based on number of mode shots the player achieved in each of the three mini modes before starting Concert Multiball.  
  
## Rawhide Multiball  
Open Hide Away lock with the captive ball (configurable number of hits) behind the L target. The gate remains open for 30 seconds. Once two balls are locked, a third ball is launched. A ball save runs while the player attempts to start multiball. Hitting any of the multiball shots (captive ball, spinner, or flip lane) starts the 3-ball multiball with a bonus based on which shot they hit and how long it takes to hit it. Jackpot on scoop (VUK). Super jackpot qualified by hitting captive ball. Super jackpot collected with Hide Away. Lift Gate is raised 15 seconds after Super Jackpot. Mega Jackpot collected with two balls in Hide Away. Jackpot value defaults to 50k (Super = 100k, Mega = 200k). Jackpot value is increased with Mini Mode completion.  
If mini modes are running when multiball starts, the minimode shots are still available.  
Playfield multiplier is based on the number of balls in play plus the number of minimodes running.
   
## Joliet Multiball  
If the player finishes Concert Multiball and Rawhide Multiball, Joliet Multiball is qualified at the left ramp. Once the left spinner has been hit, if the next switch hit is the right spinner, a 3-ball multiball will start. Jackpots can be collected at the scoop (VUK), captive ball, and super jackpots at the Hide Away (which opens and closes on a timer).
